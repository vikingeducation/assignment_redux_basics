#redux_basics

Author: Ian Halverson

This project demonstrates the basics of using Redux. The actions, reducers, etc
are located in:

the-bank/src/index.js,
the-bank/src/reducers.js,
the-bank/src/actions.js

grocery-list/src/index.js

Enter into each root folder (the-bank, grocery-list), and run "npm start" to run
the actions. Each changed state of the STORE will log into the browser console.
